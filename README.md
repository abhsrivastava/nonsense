This is my implementation of the ReasonML tutorial at https://www.stackbuilders.com/blog/nonsense-getting-started-with-reason-and-reason-react/
Although the tutorial doesn't work anymore because the api.noopschallenge.com wordbot API is no longer avaialble. I replaced it with another random word api 
available at random-word-api.herokuapp.com.
